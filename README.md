## üö® Free Project & Server Performance Notice

This API and website are provided **completely free** for the tech side project community, and are currently hosted on free-tier servers (Render.com for the API, Vercel for the website). As a result, you may experience slower performance or rate limiting during periods of high load.

**Future plans:**
- If I secure a job or receive enough donations to cover server costs, I will consider moving the API to a paid server for improved performance and reliability‚Äîespecially if more users begin to rely on the service.
- Your support and understanding are appreciated! If you find this project valuable and want to help boost its performance, consider contributing or donating to help cover server expenses.
